                Hey! ðŸ‘‹
                I'm a software engineer and a technology enthusiast who loves building stuff.
                I believe that each software is a universe in itself, a world that started from a blank canvas.
                I love the challenge of building something from nothing, of shaping ideas into something tangible and
                meaningful that makes a difference in the world.
                It is a joy and a privilege to bring these thoughts to life.
                That is the power of creation, and it is what drives me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am a Staff Engineer at <strong>Google</strong> working on Google Cloud. I have worked with
                software at every scale, as a cofounder and CTO of my startup to large scale enterprise
                application development and everything in between.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spend most of my day staring at a terminal (Foot/Ghostty) with Tmux, (Neo)Vim and Fzf as my primary
                tools. I am a big fan of simple setups, using a very specific and small set of tools with as minimal
                deviations from the defaults as possible.

                My most recent nerdy hobby is building and playing around with custom mechanical keyboards.
